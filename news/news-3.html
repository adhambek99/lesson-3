    <h1>Uzbekistan updates poverty line</h1>
    <p>
      Based on the inflation rate in 2023, the cost of minimum consumer expenses
      for 2024 amounted to 621,000 soums per month, the Statistics Agency said.
      Compared to last year, the cost of MCS increased by 9.3% (53,000 soums).
      In 2023, minimum consumer spending was 568 thousand soums per person a
      month. The agency noted that in world practice the MCS is used as a
      poverty line in order to identify the target population group in need of
      material and other social assistance from the state. When identifying the
      poverty line in a country, the characteristics of real consumption and the
      needs of the population of the target group should be taken into account.
      The MSC is also used to increase the effectiveness and targeting of tasks
      and activities defined in the strategies and programs to combat poverty.
      In addition, the minimum consumer spending amount is necessary as a
      criterion for determining the minimum amount of pensions and benefits, as
      well as for providing other types of material assistance to low-income
      families.
